# LabOne-Exploring_Table_Data
You are to perform preprocessing and exploratory analysis of a data set: exploring the statistical summaries of the features, visualizing the attributes, and addressing data quality. This report is worth 10% of the final grade. Please upload a report (one per team) with all code used, visualizations, and text in a rendered Jupyter notebook. Any visualizations that cannot be embedded in the notebook, please provide screenshots of the output.
